# Immobilisation
Description: Enzyme immobilisation is the process of attaching or confining enzymes to a solid support or within a matrix so that they remain in place and can be reused, while still retaining their catalytic activity. This process enhances enzyme stability, enables reuse, and facilitates continuous bioprocessing operations. This method enables a easy documentation and evaluation platform for immobilised enzyme processes (IEP), by taking into account, the entire production, purification, immobilisation and catalysis. It shows bottleneck steps during the entire process and faciliates a holistic comparison of different immobilisation techniques.
