Introduction\\n\\n\\n## Screening of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as green CO 2 sorbents: from solubility to viscosity†\\n\\nShokat Sarmad,* [a] Yujiao Xie, [a] Jyri-Pekka Mikkola [bc] and Xiaoyan Ji [a]\\n\\n\\nDeep eutectic solvents (DESs) as ionic liquid (IL) analogues show great potential for CO 2 capture. They\\n\\n\\nexhibit favorable solvent properties and are considered to be economical alternatives to conventional\\n\\nILs. In this study, we prepare 35 DESs and screen them in terms of their CO 2 solubility and viscosity,\\n\\n\\nboth crucial factors to be considered when designing efficient CO 2 sorbents. The influence of salt and\\n\\n\\nHBD type and structure, as well their molar ratio on the CO 2 solubility and viscosity of the DESs is\\n\\n\\ninvestigated. The viscosity and CO 2 solubility of the DESs are compared with those of other DESs and\\n\\n\\nconventional ILs. 15 DESs, which exhibit comparable CO 2 absorption capacity to choline chloride–urea\\n\\n\\nDESs, glycerol DESs and fluorinated ILs, are chosen as the promising ones. The viscosities of the selected\\n\\n\\nDESs are below 200 mPa s and are lower than those of choline chloride-based DESs. Since the viscosity\\n\\n\\nof the DESs is relatively high, on a par with those of conventional ILs, the effect of water as a co-solvent\\n\\nis investigated in order to decrease the viscosity. The addition of water to the glycerol-based DESs\\n\\n\\nimproves the kinetics of absorption by decreasing the viscosity, thus increasing the CO 2 absorption\\n\\n\\ncapacity. Dry or aqueous DESs that demonstrate a high sorption capacity and low viscosity are chosen\\n\\n\\nfor additional analysis and characterization, and further functionalization will be carried out in the future\\n\\n\\nto improve their sorption capacity.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe anthropogenic emission of CO 2 results in global warming\\nand remains a matter of great concern in our time. Carbon\\ncapture and storage (CCS) is one feasible solution to reduce\\nCO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, which is the largest\\nhuman source of CO 2 . Developing new technologies to inexpensively\\nand efficiently capture CO 2 is of great importance. [1–4] Current\\ntechnologies for CO 2 capture from power plants are mainly\\nbased on aqueous amine solutions. Generally, the amine-based\\ntechnologies result in high energy penalties in the regeneration\\n\\nof sorbent. Due to the volatile and corrosive nature of amine\\n\\nsorbents, they are considered as potential threats to the environment and humans. [5–7]\\n\\n\\nUsing ionic liquids (ILs) for reversible CO 2 capture is\\nproposed as one of the most promising methods, due to the\\ninherent advantages of ILs over traditional aqueous amine\\n\\n\\na Department of Engineering Science and Mathematics, Division of Energy Science,\\nLuleå University of Technology, 971 87 Luleå, Sweden.\\n\\nE-mail: shokat.sarmad@ltu.se\\nb Technical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Chemical-Biological Centre, Umeå\\nUniversity, SE-90871, Umeå, Sweden\\nc Industrial Chemistry & Reaction Engineering, John Gadolin Process Chemistry\\nCentre, Åbo Akademi University, Biskopsgatan 8, Fl-20500, Åbo-Turku, Finland\\n\\n - Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: [Tables S1–S4].

ILs are well known as physical CO 2 sorbents with high\\nCO 2 solubility, and their CO 2 -philicity can be tuned by choosing\\nan appropriate anion or cation. Taking the advantages of the\\ntunability of ILs into consideration, task specified ILs can be\\ndesigned to chemically react with CO 2 . [8,9] For example, taskspecific ILs that contain amine groups are capable of reversibly\\nbonding CO 2 molecules via the formation of carbamate salts.\\nHowever, employing ILs for CO 2 capture in large scale industrial\\napplications is hindered due to several drawbacks such as high\\nviscosity and complicated and high-cost synthesis and purification processes. Furthermore, there are growing concerns in\\nregard to the toxicity of several ILs. [10,11]\\n\\nDeep eutectic solvents (DESs) are a new class of ILs containing\\nasymmetric and large ions with low lattice energy and hence low\\nmelting points. [12] DESs are typically formed by mixing a hydrogen\\nbond acceptor (HBA) (quaternary ammonium or phosphonium\\nsalts) and a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) such as a carboxylic acid,\\namide, amine, alcohol or metal halide. An appropriate molar ratio\\nis required to form a eutectic mixture with a lower melting point.\\nHBAs and HBDs are able to interact with each other via hydrogen\\nbonds.

These new\\nsolvents have been employed in different areas of chemistry like\\nmetal extraction, [12] nanotechnology, [16] separation processes, [17]\\n\\nstabilization of DNA, [18] material chemistry, [19] organic synthesis [20]\\n\\nand so on. DESs can be easily prepared at a low cost and in high\\npurity without further purification. Many inexpensive quaternary\\nsalts are available, in addition to a wide choice of cheap,\\nbiodegradable and non-toxic HBDs. Therefore, it is possible to\\nform many novel and inexpensive DES systems. [15,21] Indeed,\\nDESs are considered to be a green and environmentally benign\\nCO 2 capture medium, and they have been extensively explored\\nduring the last few decades due to their similarities with ILs.\\nThe first DES was introduced by Abbott et al. [22] It was made\\nup of choline chloride (ChCl) and urea in a molar ratio of 1 : 2.\\nBoth of these components are non-toxic, readily available and\\nbiodegradable. [22] Recently, the possibility of applying DESs as\\nCO 2 separation media has been extensively surveyed. For the\\nfirst time, Li et al. reported on the solubility of CO 2 in eutectic\\nmixtures of ChCl and urea in molar ratios of 1 : 1.5, 1 : 2 and\\n1 : 2.5, as a function of pressure (up to 13 MPa) and temperature\\n(313.15, 323.15 and 333.15 K). [23] Their studies revealed that the\\nCO 2 solubility in the DESs depends on the molar ratio of salt-toHBD, pressure and temperature. The CO 2 solubility increased\\nwith increasing pressure and decreasing temperature. Among\\nthe investigated DESs, ChCl–urea (1 : 2) exhibited the highest\\nsolubility. The CO 2 solubilities in the studied DESs were in the\\nsame order as those of ammonium-based ILs, but were lower\\n\\nthan those of imidazolium-based ILs under similar conditions.\\n\\nThe nature of HBDs has a significant influence on the CO 2\\nsolubility in DESs. For example, by choosing lactic acid as the\\nHBD, the CO 2 absorption capacity is lower than that of ureabased DESs with an identical molar ratio (1 : 2). [24] On the\\ncontrary, using glycerol or ethylene glycol as the HBD results\\nin the promotion of the CO 2 absorption capacity up to the level\\nof that of imidazolium-based ILs. [25,26] All these DESs are capable\\nof physically absorbing CO 2 . Sze and coworkers reported the first\\ntask-specific DES system composed of ChCl, glycerol, and a\\nsuperbase. [27] The superbase was responsible for the deprotonation of the OH groups in glycerol and ChCl, resulting in the\\nformation of active alkoxide anions. This species facilitated the\\nreversible capture of CO 2 under ambient conditions. However,\\ncompared to conventional ILs, research on DESs as CO 2 sorbents\\nis still limited, and the CO 2 absorption capacities of the available\\nDESs are still relatively low.\\nThe main goal of our study is to develop novel DESs with\\nhigh CO 2 sorption capacity and low viscosity for CO 2 separation.\\nTo achieve this, 35 DESs are synthesized as the first step, in order\\nto understand how the HBD, HBA and other factors affect the\\nproperties of DESs. The synthesized DESs are screened based on\\ntheir viscosity and CO 2 absorption capacity to find appropriate\\nDESs for CO 2 separation. Following this study, the performance\\nof the promising DESs will be improved by functionalization or\\nthe addition of appropriate co-solvents.\\n\\n\\n### 2. Experimental section\\n\\n2.1. Chemicals\\n\\n\\nCO 2 (mole fraction Z99.9%) was received from AGA AB (Linde\\ngroup). N-Benzyl-2-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyl ethanaminium choride\\n(BHDE) and octanoic acid (OCT) were delivered by Sigma-Aldrich.\\nAcetic acid (AC), ethanolamine (EA) and urea were purchased\\nfrom Shanghai Shenbo Chemical Company, VWR, and Merck,\\nrespectively. Lactic acid (LA) and 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) were\\nobtained from Shanghai Lingfeng chemical reagent company.\\nCholine chloride (ChCl), benzyltimethylammonium chloride\\n(BTMA) and glycerol (Gly) were purchased from the Simopharm\\nchemical reagent company. Benzyltriethylammonium chloride\\n(BTEA), guanidinium hydrochloride (Gua), methyltriphenyl phosphonium bromide (MTPP), tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB),\\ntetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC), tetraethylammonium\\nchloride (TEAC), triethylmethylammonim chloride (TEMA),\\ntetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC), tetrapropylammonium\\nchloride (TPAC), ethylene glycol (EG) and levulinic acid (LV)\\nwere purchased from the Aladdin company. All chemicals were\\nanalytical grade reagents and were used as received.\\n\\n\\n2.2. Preparation of DESs\\n\\n\\nIn the present work, we synthesized 35 novel DESs composed of\\nammonium or phosphonium salts and different HBDs. The eutectic\\nmixtures were prepared by mixing the appropriate molar ratio of\\nsalt and HBD under vigorous stirring at 333–353 K. The resulting\\nclear homogeneous and colourless solution was stirred for an\\nadditional 2 hours and then left to cool down to room temperature. At this stage, the DESs were ready to use and no purification\\nstep was needed. The reason for this is that during preparation\\nof the DESs, no solvents were employed and the obtained\\nmixture was pure. The melting points of all synthesized DESs\\nare lower than room temperature, i.e. all DESs are in the liquid\\nphase at room temperature. Table 1 shows the abbreviations for\\nthe synthesized DESs and lists their compositions.\\n\\n\\n2.3. CO 2 solubility measurements\\n\\n\\nCO 2 solubility measurements were performed on a vapor–liquid\\nequilibrium set-up. The employed set-up used in this work is\\ndescribed in previous works. [28,29] The apparatus contains a gas\\nreservoir, an equilibrium cell, a magnetic stirrer and two\\npressure transducers with a precision of 0.075%. During measurements, the equilibrium cell and gas reservoir were placed\\nin a water bath where the temperature was kept constant using\\na thermostat with an accuracy of �0.1 K. An adequate amount\\nof the DES sample was loaded into the equilibrium cell. After\\nthat, an appropriate amount of gas was introduced into the\\nequilibrium cell and dissolved in the solvent. The pressure of\\nthe equilibrium cell was then recorded. When the pressure\\nbecame constant, this point was indicated as the equilibrium\\nstate and the corresponding pressure was measured. Using the\\npressure changes in the gas reservoir, the equilibrium pressure\\nand the volume of the equilibrium cell, the number of moles of\\ndissolved gas in the liquid phase was determined by assuming\\nthat only CO 2 existed in the vapour phase.

Results and discussion\\n\\n\\n3.1. CO 2 solubility\\n\\n\\n3.1.1. Validation of the experimental method. Before measuring the CO 2 solubility in the synthesized DESs, to validate\\nour experimental method, we measured the CO 2 solubility in\\nethylene glycol (at 303.15 K), in ChCl–1,2-propanediol DES\\n(1 : 2, at 308.15 K), and in water (at 308.15 K). The measured\\nCO 2 solubilities in these three samples were compared with the\\n\\n\\n\\nexperimental data reported in the literature. The comparison is\\npresented in Fig. 1. As can be seen, the results obtained in this\\nwork agree well with those reported in the literature, confirming\\nthe validity of our experimental method as well as the reliability\\nof our reported data. [30–32]\\n\\n3.1.2. CO 2 solubility in the synthesized DESs. The CO 2\\nsolubility in the synthesized DESs was further measured at\\n298.15 K and pressures of up to 2 MPa. The measured experimental data for all studied systems are reported in Table 2.\\nBased on the measured experimental results for the different\\nDESs, the influence of salt and HBD type, their structure, molar\\nratio and pressure on CO 2 solubility was further analyzed and\\ndiscussed. The influence of these different factors on the CO 2\\nsolubility of the DESs is described below:\\n\\n\\nPressure. For all the studied systems, the solubility increased\\nwith increasing pressure, as is typically expected for gas solubility in\\nliquids. Generally, the CO 2 solubility in the DESs follows Henry’s law,\\ni.e., the CO 2 solubility is proportional to its partial pressure. [33]\\n\\n\\nNature of the HBD. The type of HBD used affected the CO 2\\nsolubility of the DESs. As an example, the CO 2 solubility in the\\nDESs composed of tetraethylammonium chloride as the HBA,\\nas well as acetic acid, lactic acid or levulinic acid as the HBD, is\\ndepicted in Fig. 2. As can be seen, the studied systems follow\\n\\n\\n\\n292 | _New J.

These differences\\n\\nare attributed to the interactions between the groups in the HBDs\\nand CO 2 .\\n\\nBased on the molecular structure of the HBDs in lactic acid,\\ndue to the vicinity of the hydroxyl group to the carboxylic group,\\nthe intermolecular hydrogen bonds are stronger compared to\\nthose of levulinic acid or acetic acid, and thus it is difficult to\\nbreak intermolecular hydrogen bonds to interact with CO 2\\nmolecules. Consequently, the CO 2 solubility in the lactic acidbased DES is the lowest. In the case of acetic acid, the intermolecular hydrogen bonds are the weakest.\\nConsequently, acetic acid molecules can interact with CO 2\\neasily, and thus the CO 2 solubility in the acetic acid-based DES\\nis higher than that of the other DESs.\\n\\n\\nAlkyl chain length in the HBA or HBD. The comparison of CO 2\\nsolubility in the acetic acid-based DESs indicates that the CO 2\\nsolubility increases with increasing alkyl chain length of the\\nHBA. For example, the CO 2 solubility increased from 1.177 to\\n1.411 mol kg [�][1] when the alkyl chain length increased from ethyl to\\nbutyl (i.e. from tetraethylammonium to tetrabutylammonium).\\nSimilarly, the increase in the number of carbon atoms in the\\nalkyl chain of HBD also leads to an increase of CO 2 solubility.\\nFor example, by increasing the alkyl chain length from acetic\\nacid to octanoic acid in TEAC–AC and TEAC–OCT, the CO 2\\nsolubility increased from 1.230 to 1.390 mol kg [�][1] .

The contribution of H 2 O to the uptake\\nof CO 2 was very limited. By further increasing the amount of\\nH 2 O, the gas solubility decreased at a constant temperature\\nand pressure due to the low solubility of CO 2 in H 2 O. Similar\\nbehaviour was reported for (2-hydroxyethyl)-trimethyl-ammonium\\n(S)-2-pyrrolidine-carboxylic acid salt [Cholin][Pro]-polyethylene\\nglycol 200 (PEG200) by Li et al. [38] The addition of PEG200 also\\nresulted in a decrease in viscosity of the IL and thus improved\\nthe CO 2 absorption rate. However, PEG200 exhibited a limited\\ncontribution to the CO 2 absorption capacity, and the CO 2 solubility\\ndecreased with increasing the amount of PEG200 due to the low\\nsolubility of CO 2 in PEG200. [38]\\n\\nBased on the results presented in Table 2, 15 DESs which\\nexhibited CO 2 solubilities above 1 mol kg [�][1] were considered as\\npromising candidates to carry out the comparative study\\ndetailed in Section 3.3. These promising DESs were: BTEA–\\nAC, BTMA–AC, ChCl–EA, Gua–EA, MTPP–AC, MTPP–LV–AC,\\n\\nTBAB–AC, TBAB–EA, TBAC–AC, TEAC–AC, TEAC–OCT, TEMA–\\nAC, TMAC–AC, TPAC–AC and TPAC–EA.\\n\\n\\n3.2. Viscosity\\n\\n\\nViscosity describes the resistance of a fluid to flow and in fact, it\\nis a measure of the internal friction of a moving fluid. [39] DESs,\\nsimilar to conventional ILs, have a relatively higher viscosity in\\ncomparison to other organic solvents, causing problems in\\nhandling, filtering and stirring. Investigating the viscosity of\\nDESs for industrial applications, such as CO 2 capture processes,\\nis very important.\\nFor some DESs during the CO 2 capture process, the viscosity\\nincreases with increasing amount of CO 2 . [7,27,40,41] The increase\\nin viscosity results in a reduction in the heat and mass transfer,\\nwhich in turn results in a decreased CO 2 absorption rate and\\nhigher energy utilization in the CO 2 separation cycle. In order\\nto capture CO 2 with a high efficiency, it is essential to obtain a\\nbalance between the viscosity and the CO 2 absorption capacity.\\nIn this work, the viscosities of the synthesized DESs were\\nmeasured in the temperature range of 293.15–333.15 K. The\\nmeasured results are listed in Table 3. The viscosity of the DESs\\nis sensitive to temperature, the type of salt and HBD, the salt\\nsymmetry, the water content of the DESs and the molar ratio of\\n\\nsalt : HBD.\\n\\n3.2.1. Temperature. Increasing the temperature had a converse effect on viscosity. The reason is that high temperatures\\npromote molecular movement and kinetic energy, thus weakening the attractive forces between molecules and contributing\\nto decreasing viscosity. For all the studied DESs, the viscosity\\ndecreased with increasing temperature.\\n3.2.2. HBD type. The effect of the nature of the HBD on the\\nviscosity is undeniable. The presence of carboxylic or hydroxyl\\ngroups leads to the establishment of hydrogen bonds, thus\\nresulting in increased viscosity. As an example, glycerol contains three hydroxyl groups, which are capable of forming a\\nstrong hydrogen bond network. The strong hydrogen bond\\n\\n\\n\\nnetwork results in low mobility of free species within the DES.\\nTherefore, the DESs based on glycerol exhibit high viscosity, and\\nthis is illustrated by our experimental results listed in Table 3.\\nThe comparison of the viscosity of the DESs composed of\\nTEMA–GLY and TEMA–EG reveals that the presence of one\\nextra hydroxyl group in glycerol compared to ethylene glycol\\ngives rise to higher viscosity (from 41.69 to 236.59 mPa s at\\n298.15 K). The increased viscosity is attributed to the establishment of an extensive hydrogen bond network. On the basis of\\nhole theory, the DESs containing bigger HBD molecules give\\n\\nrise to an increased ionic radius due to the formation of a\\n\\nhydrogen bond network between anions and HBDs, resulting in\\na very small free volume. The extensive hydrogen bond network\\nlowers the mobility of free species within the DESs, and thus\\nresults in higher viscosity. [42,43]\\n\\n3.2.3. Alkyl chain length of HBD. The alkyl chain length of\\nthe HBD and that of the salt affected the viscosity of the DESs.\\nAs demonstrated, for the DESs based on triethylmethylammonium\\nchloride (TEAC), an increase in the alkyl chain length of HBD from\\nacetic acid to octanoic acid led to an increase in the viscosity from\\n\\n21.50 to 65.86 mPa s at 298.15 K.\\n\\n3.2.4. Molar ratio of (salt : HBD). By increasing the molar\\nratio of salt : HBD, the viscosity of the synthesized DESs\\ndecreased. For example, the viscosity of TPAC–EA at 298.15 K\\ndecreased from 55.13 to 38.72 mPa s by increasing the molar\\nratio from 1 : 4 to 1 : 7. By increasing the amount of acetic acid\\nin TEAC–AC from 1 : 2 to 1 : 3, the viscosity decreased from\\n\\n27.52 to 21.50 mPa s. Similar behaviour was observed for the\\n\\ncholine acetate–glycerol system, as well as the tertrabutylammonium bromide-based DESs. [44,45]\\n\\n\\n3.2.5. Using co-HBD. The viscosity of the DESs can be\\ntuned by selecting an appropriate HBD or using a co-HBD\\nbased on the measured viscosity results. When choosing acetic\\nacid (0.035 mol) as a co-HBD in the DES composed of MTPP–LV\\n(1 : 3), the viscosity was significantly reduced from 957.09 to\\n33.95 mPa s at 298.15 K. Similarly, by adding glycerol as the\\nsecond HBD to the DES composed of ChCl–sugar-based polyols,\\na solution with lower viscosity was obtained. For example, by\\nadding glycerol at 323.15 K, the viscosity of ChCl : glucose (1 : 1)\\ndecreased from 34 400 to 930 mPa s in ChCl : glucose : glycerol\\n(1 : 0.5 : 0.5). [46]\\n\\n\\n3.3. Comparison with other DESs\\n\\n\\n3.3.1. CO 2 solubility. Until now, various different DESs have\\nbeen studied as CO 2 sorbents, and most of them have been\\nbased on choline chloride (ChCl) and different types of HBDs.\\nTable S1 (ESI†) summarizes the CO 2 solubilities of the DESs\\nreported by others until today.\\nLeron et al. reported the solubility of CO 2 in a variety of\\nChCl-based DESs at moderate pressures in the temperature\\nrange of 303.15–343.15 K.
